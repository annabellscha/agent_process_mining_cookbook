By analyzing actual execution patterns at scale, you can discover bottlenecks, identify success and failure patterns, and generate actionable insights that traditional evaluation methods miss.\n",

    "> **What is Process Mining?** Process mining is a family of techniques that extract knowledge from event logs to discover, monitor, and improve real processes. When applied to AI agents, it reveals the actual execution paths your agents take in production—not just what you designed, but what's really happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is Langfuse?** [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) is an open-source LLM observability platform that captures traces of your AI applications. Each trace contains a sequence of observations (tool calls, LLM generations, spans) that can be analyzed as process events.\n",
    "\n",

    "This process mining analysis revealed:\n",

    "1. **Execution Patterns** - The actual paths your agent takes in production\n",
    "2. **Success vs Failure Patterns** - Which execution paths lead to good outcomes\n",
    "3. **Bottlenecks** - Activities consuming disproportionate time\n",
    "4. **Inefficiencies** - Loops, cycles, and repeated calls indicating problems\n",

    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Address high-priority bottlenecks and inefficiencies\n",
    "2. Investigate low-performing patterns to understand failure causes\n",
